# Quilt Arranger

This app will take in a number of columns, rows, and types of fabric. It returns a randomly arranged quilt, where no two fabrics are side by side. It also allows you to swap any of the quilt blocks and individually customize each quilt block.
I made this app because I was helping my wife arrange quilt blocks on the floor, I had recently had achilles surgery and found it to be a pain to do on the floor. It seemed every time we would swap two blocks it would create another problem of two of the same blocks touching. I viewed the quilt as an array of arrays, where each row was an array of blocks, and I could compare each element in the array to it's neighbor as well as compare it's index to the index of the array below it.
